1. The "News Feed" Query

Goal: Find the ContentBody and Username of posts created by people that a specific user (e.g., UserID = 1) is following.

SQL:

SELECT
    U.UsernameUnique,
    P.ContentBody
FROM Users U
JOIN Posts P ON U.UserID = P.UserID
JOIN Follows F ON P.UserID = F.FollowingUserID
WHERE F.FollowerUserID = 1;

Relational Algebra:
πUsernameUnique,ContentBody​(σFollowerUserID=1​(Follows)⋈FollowingUserID=UserID​Posts⋈UserID=UserID​Users)

Breakdown:

    σ: Select rows from Follows where the follower is User 1.

    ⋈: Join that result with Posts (matching the person being followed).

    ⋈: Join that result with Users to get the username.

    π: Project (display) only the Username and Content.

2. Finding "Trending" Posts (Aggregation)

Goal: List the PostID and LikeCount for all posts that have more than 100 likes, sorted by popularity.

SQL:

SELECT
    PostID,
    COUNT(*) AS LikeCount
FROM Post_Likes
GROUP BY PostID
HAVING COUNT(*) > 100;

Relational Algebra (Extended):
σLikeCount>100​(PostID​Gcount(∗)→LikeCount​(Post_Likes))

Breakdown:

    G: Group by PostID and Count the rows (naming the result LikeCount).

    σ: Filter (Select) only the groups where LikeCount is greater than 100.

3. User Profile & Bio (Basic Join)

Goal: Get the DisplayName, Bio, and AvatarURL for a user with the email 'alice@example.com'.

SQL:

SELECT
    P.DisplayName,
    P.Bio,
    P.AvatarURL
FROM Profiles P
JOIN Users U ON P.UserID = U.UserID
WHERE U.Email = 'alice@example.com';

Relational Algebra:
πDisplayName,Bio,AvatarURL​(P⋈P.UserID=U.UserID​(σEmail=′alice@example.com′​(Users)))

Breakdown:

    σ: Find the specific row in Users matching the email.

    ⋈: Join that single user record with the Profiles table.

    π: Show the profile details.

4. Content Discovery via Hashtags

Goal: Find all posts that contain the hashtag "#Tech".

SQL:

SELECT P.ContentBody
FROM Posts P
JOIN Post_Hashtags PH ON P.PostID = PH.PostID
JOIN Hashtags H ON PH.HashtagID = H.HashtagID
WHERE H.TagName = '#Tech';

Relational Algebra:
πContentBody​(Posts⋈(Post_Hashtags⋈σTagName=′#Tech′​(Hashtags)))

Breakdown:

    σ: Filter Hashtags to find the ID for "#Tech".

    ⋈: Join with Post_Hashtags to find the links.

    ⋈: Join with Posts to get the actual content.

5. Moderation Queue (Set Logic)

Goal: Find the IDs of users who have been reported for 'Harassment' but are NOT yet banned (their status is still Active).

SQL:

SELECT R.ReporterUserID
FROM Reports R
JOIN Report_Categories RC ON R.CategoryID = RC.CategoryID
JOIN Users U ON R.ReporterUserID = U.UserID
JOIN Account_Statuses AS_Status ON U.StatusID = AS_Status.StatusID
WHERE RC.CategoryName = 'Harassment'
AND AS_Status.StatusName = 'Active';

Relational Algebra:
πReporterUserID​(Reports⋈CategoryID​σCategoryName=′Harassment′​(Report_Categories))⋈
